# dna

Java app for constructing DNA sequence from pieces. Made for testing 2 algorythms - exact and approximate.

Each algorythm has 2 versions - complete search and stopping when first match is found. 

Tests can be made upon different temperatures, length of DNA, occurance of positive errors (more specific pieces then in reality existed or added pieces that never existed).
